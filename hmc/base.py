        Parameters
        ----------
        energy_func : function(vector, dictionary]) -> scalar
            Function which returns energy (marginal negative log density) of a
            position state. Should also accept a (potentially empty) `cache`
            dictionary argument which correspond to cached intermediate results
            which are fully determined by position state. If no `energy_grad`
            is provided it will be attempted to use Autograd to calculate the
            gradient and so this function should be then be defined using the
            `autograd.numpy` interface.
        energy_grad : function(vector, dictionary) -> vector or None
            Function which returns gradient of energy function at a position
            state. Should also accept a (potentially empty) `cache` dictionary
            argument which correspond to cached intermediate results which are
            fully determined by position state. If not provided it will be
            attempted to use Autograd to create a gradient function from the
            provided `energy_func`. In this case any cached results will be
            ignored when calculating the gradient as there is no information
            available of how to propagate the derivatives through them.
        prng : RandomState
            Pseudo-random number generator. If `None` a new Numpy RandomState
            instance is created.
        mom_resample_coeff : scalar in [0, 1]
            Coefficient specifying degree with which to resample momentum
            after each Metropolis-Hastings Hamiltonian move. If equal to 1 the
            momentum will be independently sampled from its conditional given
            the current position, while if equal to 0 the momentum will be
            left at the value returned from the M-H step. Values in between
            these two extremes will lead to a new momentum which is a weighted
            sun of an independent draw from the conditional and the current
            momentum state.
